### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

My name is Greg. I have a PhD in Physiological Sciences with a minor in neuroscience. I'm also an engineer, so that's why I'm dabbling in coding occasionally. I've started my own [Github page](https://gielpy.github.io/) and am always looking for new datasets to dig into.

Otherwise, ask me about baseball or my work if you are interested in the neuroscience of addiction.

Thanks and see ya!
